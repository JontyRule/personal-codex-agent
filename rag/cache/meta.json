As a Process Data Analyst and Product Owner at Stone Three - a leading South African industrial IoT and data analytics firm specialising in mining and mineral processing - my role has allowed me to work with many high-calibre individuals. Jonty stands out as among the most eager, capable, and collaborative contributors I’ve encountered. From the outset of his engagement, Jonty demonstrated a keen enthusiasm for his work, consistently going above and beyond what was expected of him. He quickly adapted to complex project contexts involving smart sensor data analytics and mineral processing, showing both technical aptitude and a willingness to engage with unfamiliar topics. One of Jonty’s most impressive qualities is his natural inclination towards teamwork and inclusive collaboration. During our joint projects, he took the initiative to involve colleagues from multiple departments, ensuring all participants felt heard and were able to contribute meaningfully. This collaborative atmosphere, fostered by Jonty's leadership, directly improved project outcomes and morale. Jonty’s professionalism also shone through in his approach to communication. On occasions where miscommunications or misunderstandings arose - inevitable in fast-paced technical environments - Jonty addressed them proactively and tactfully. He would clarify objectives, recalibrate team expectations, and implement solutions promptly, minimizing disruption and promoting a culture of continuous improvement. In summary, Jonty Rule is an asset to any process engineering team. His technical competence, willingness to take initiative, and exemplary interpersonal skills set him apart. I confidently recommend him for any future opportunities and am certain he will excel in any challenging and collaborative environment. Should you require any additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me. --- **Kind regards,** Barend Coetzee Process Data Scientist (Product Management & Technical Services) 082 832 5040 https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernard-coetzee-6b9580b8/",
