# Resume / CV

## SUMMARY
As a technology enthusiast with strong interests in data science, software development, and technology, I am always looking for challenging problems to solve.  
I enjoy connecting with people and value collaboration. I have a massive hunger to learn and am always busy dreaming or working on some project.  
I am fascinated by the field of AI and love finding creative ways to get the best out of it.  
I enjoy teaching and feel giving back is very important, currently in the process of working with the wonderful team at Stone Three Impact as a volunteer where I created an arduino powered reaction timer workshop. 

NOTE: Stone Three and Stone Three Impact are very different!
